Hi I'm Hirai.

Last year I visited Denmark for the first time. I went to Spain, France.
In each country there were many interesting and exciting places.
I love soccer and I'm interested in European culture.

So this's report is about places that I found fascinating on my vacation.

First I want to introduce the soccer stadium "Camp Nou" in Spain, Barcelona.
This stadium is official stadium of Barcelona.
It's one of famous and popular stadiums around the world so one of my dream was to visit here.
It just feels so exciting to go in it and I could watch soccer game of Barcelona.

The second stadium is "Stade de France" in France, Paris.
This stadium is the national stadium of France.
It's also one of famous stadiums around the world.
There was final game of France world cup here in 1998.
I watched the game on TV when I was high school student.
It is very memorable for me.

The final place I want to introduce is the towncape in Denmark, Copenhagen.
Unfortunately, this is not soccer stadium.
But it was attractive for me because it has beautiful riverside and colorful houses. There is a river that runs through the area there.
